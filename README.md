This repository contains the full R code, dataset, and presentation material for the entry "Using Dynamic Data-Driven Simulations on MRT Passenger Traffic Data For Optimizing Service Performance Strategies" originally presented to Accenture Philippines for their 2018 Big Data Challenge.

For potential contributors or those who would wish to adapt the code to their purposes (but seriously, why would you?) below are some useful information regarding the structure of the code. In retrospect, the code itself was built on too many for loops - at least more than an R developer should be comfortable with - which explains the lengthy comments at the beginning of the code (added at the time of writing) agonizing over the long running times.
